# Editing the Unity YAML file

Generally, files with the extensions .meta, .asset, .prefab, and .unity are operated in the Unity Editor via MCP.
If instructed to perform an operation that cannot be performed through MCP, edit the file directly.

Please read the following page before editing a file.
